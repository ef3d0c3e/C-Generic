# C-Generic -- Generics in C!
Who thought C had no generics?

## What
This a simple linked-list implementation in C that allows re-usability through the use of generics.

## Why
Some languages claim the have generics, like Rust or C++, however these languages just perform some higher level type substitution.
This results in larger binaries where almost all generic types need to be exported in the final binary. However, this methods allows for type-specific optimization
and guarantees some of the best performances.

## Compiling
